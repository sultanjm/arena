"""
CDF of a mixed random variable
state can be a mixed multi-dimensional RV
conditioned on multi-dimensional mixed variables
lets start by [controls + actions] as a single set of inputs
empty actions is no more a distinct case
e.g. 
N x R x I x S == inputs
N x R x I x S == outputs
lets limit to bounded parameters to begin with
so,
I x S only
state can only be a collection of sequences and intervals
lets limit to uniform distributions on intervals
problem: how to fix a realized distribution?
assumption: smoothness
lets chop intervals into `delta` bins
